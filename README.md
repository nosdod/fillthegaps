Scrape a website for missing images and fill the gaps

So in case you’re getting bored ....

One of the gardening related things we like to do is visit rare plant fairs http://www.rareplantfair.co.uk/ – these are often located in peoples gardens which themselves are nice to visit, and raise money for charity by charging an admission fee. The vendors who attend are usually small nurseries that specialise in growing rare plants – ones you don’t see in every garden centre. At the moment these fairs aren’t happening, but the nurseries still have plants to sell. A lot of them have websites, but often not good ones! 

One of the nurseries is edulis.co.uk. Their website is missing pictures for loads of the plants – see https://www.edulis.co.uk/collections/herbaceous-perennial

So the challenge is ....

‘Fill the gaps’
•	Find the plants for which no image is displayed
•	Search the web for a ‘stock’ image of the plant
•	Render the website page with the missing images filled in
Extras
•	Allow multiple stock images to be found and rendered
•	Make it work for any website with missing images

Anna reckons something like this can be done using Nightwatch (UI testing tool), and I’m undecided yet as to the angle I’m going for.
